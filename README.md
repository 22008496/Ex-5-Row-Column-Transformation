# Aim:  To write a C program to implement the Row Column transformation.


# Algorithm: STEP1: Read the plaintext P.
STEP2: Determine the number of rows:
STEP3: L = length(P)
STEP4: R = ceil(L / N) → Number of rows needed
STEP5: Create an R × N matrix M and fill it:
STEP6: Fill the matrix row-wise with characters from P.
STEP7: If the matrix is not completely filled, pad remaining cells with a filler character (e.g., 'X').
STEP8: Read the matrix column-wise using the column key:
STEP9: For each column index K[i] in the key array:
STEP10: Read the column K[i] from top to bottom and append characters to the ciphertext.
STEP11: Display the final encrypted message.
